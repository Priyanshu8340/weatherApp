# weatherApp

This is a weather displaying web-app that we made as a group  project, while playing around with Open Weather API. It uses open weather API to fetch data about the weather and displays it, we have implemented geo-location detection. It also shows the weather data for the next 7 days. we made it to practice and implement async-JS and learn more on REST-APIs. Completed it over a weekend.
